On Angular 4 Onwards

Angular 4 will be a drop-in replacement for most users. It should be as simple as updating your package.json with the appropriate version numbers.

--- Why Angular?
- It's modular.
- It's build on a static language: TypeScript (a type superscript of JavaScript).
- It's backed by Google and has a large community of developers.

--- Angular JS vs Angular
- Angular JS = Version 1
- Angular = Version 2

Getting Started with Webpack(https://teamtreehouse.com/library/getting-started-with-webpack)

Each Angular Application needs at least 1 Root Module:
- Services (Internal or part of 3th party modules), 
- Components (the heart of the application: templates, styles and basic logic). NgModule is the container for your application,  
- 3th party

WebPack is an open-source Module-Loader. 
SystemJS: QuickStart to dynamicly load node-packages into the browser.

"An Angular Application needs a Module. And a Module needs a Component. Each of these need a bit of meta data by using decorators to apply some configuration. Modules and Components are regular JavaScript classes. Adding each component to the declarations is required."
